'''
Write a function that returns the first non-duplicated character in a string.
For example, the string, "minimum" has two characters that only exist onceâ€”the
"n" and the "u", so your function should return the "n", since it occurs first.
The function should have an efficiency of O(N).

        if word_map.get(el, 0) == 0:
            word_map[el] = 1
        else:
            word_map[el] += 1
    for el in word:
        if word_map.get(el) == 1:
            return el
